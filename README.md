Lowest Cost Across An NxM Matrix

## Getting Started

To run the code simply:

    npm install
    npm test

Then open a browser such as chrome and navigate to the karma URL. You can also install and use PhantomJS for a headless run but I didn't go to the work of setting that up. Enjoy!

## Side Notes

All code is test driven so there is no console logging or "bootstrap" application. If you want to see this running you can load the code in your console and run `subject.solveMatrix(matrix)` on whatever matrix you want to see solved. Happy Solving!
